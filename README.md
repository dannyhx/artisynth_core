# Large Growth Deformations of Thin Tissue using Solid-Shells

This is a branch of [ArtiSynth](https://www.artisynth.org) to enable growth for
solid-shells. The growth simulator was developed for the thesis titled
_Large Growth Deformations of Thin Tissue using Solid-Shells_ by Danny Huang, 
and has been made open-source to ensure reproducibility of the methods and 
experiments.

 















[ArtiSynth source code](https://github.com/artisynth/artisynth_core)



This is the core distribution of ArtiSynth, a 3D mechanical modeling
system that supports the combined simulation of multibody and finite
element models, together with contact and constraints.  While targeted
at biomechanical and biomedical applications, it can also be used for
general purpose mechanical simulation. It is freely available under a
two-clause BSD-style open source license.

The system is implemented in Java, and provides a rich set of modeling
components, including particles, rigid bodies, finite elements with
both linear and nonlinear materials, point-to-point muscles, and
various bilateral and unilateral constraints including contact. A
graphical interface allows interactive component navigation, model
editing, and simulation control.

Full details, videos and documentation are provided on the ArtiSynth
website at https://www.artisynth.org.

For details on how to install artisynth_core from Github, see the
section "Cloning from Github" in the installation guide appropriate to
your system at https://www.artisynth.org/doc/info/installation.
